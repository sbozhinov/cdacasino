# cdacasino
This is a snapshot of a cdacasino some time before it went live (and then later replaced with another design). 
I was using cda casino's design docs and photos and translated it into html/css, as well as added menu, jQuery sliders and
pulling up data from MySQL server for the events section. Beginner level PHP code used to make header/footer modules and connecting to DB.
