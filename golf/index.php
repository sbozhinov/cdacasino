        <h2> Circling Raven Golf Club</h2>
        <p>
            Designed by legendary course designer Gene Bates, Circling Raven has
            consistently been rated as one of the top public courses in the country.
            Both Golf Digest and Golf Magazine have rated it in their Top 10.</p>
        <p>
            The 7,189 yard, par 72 course meanders through 620 visually stunning
            acres adjoining the Coeur d’Alene National Forest. The course’s five sets
            of tees ensure a challenging round for players of every level. Greens fees
            are all-inclusive, and include a cart with GPS plus unlimited range play.
